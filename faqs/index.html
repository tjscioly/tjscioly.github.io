Everybody, regardless of prior experience, is given equal chances based solely on their abilities.</p><h3 id=whom-may-i-list-as-my-reference-in-my-application>Whom may I list as my reference in my application?</h3><p>As the application form indicates, you may list any previous teacher or coach. This includes division B coaches and, if you have been on TJSO before, TJSO sponsors.</p><h3 id=should-i-prepare-for-the-diagnostic-test>Should I prepare for the diagnostic test?</h3><p>There is no need to prepare for the diagnostic; we will be testing your ability to problem solve, not how much you know about science.</p><h3 id=how-much-time-commitment-does-science-olympiad-require>How much time commitment does Science Olympiad require?</h3><p>You can at least expect two hours each week for our weekly Thursday afterschool meetings. However, the majority of time spent preparing will be at home, in your own free time. Exactly how much time you spend is largely dependent on your events and your partners, for event types and preparation needs vary widely. Generally, we recommend developing a weekly schedule with your partner that works with both of you. As an example, this might include spending a couple hours each weekend taking tests and studying together with your partner for a study event.</p><h3 id=is-science-olympiad-year-round-or-is-it-seasonal>Is Science Olympiad year-round or is it seasonal?</h3><p>SO is considered a year-round activity, with each new year of SO called a “season”. However, due to competition policy, when it comes time for states, we are only allowed to send 15 people from the original 45. So, some of our team members compete up until the regional tournament in February, while others continue through the entire season. That said, it is possible to opt-out of the states team if you’re looking for a shorter season.</p><h3 id=does-science-olympiad-require-background-knowledge-andor-prior-experience>Does Science Olympiad require background knowledge and/or prior experience?</h3><p>Absolutely not! While background knowledge and experience may be helpful, they are not necessary for success. You will find an entire team of wonderful people to get you on board.</p><hr><p>If you have more questions, feel free to <a href=https://activities.tjhsst.edu/scienceolympiad/leadership-contact/>contact us</a> at <a href=mailto:tjhsstscio@gmail.com>tjhsstscio@gmail.com</a>!</p></div><footer><p>Last modified on Wed, Mar 25, 2020</p></footer></main></body></html>
