Stay tuned for more info.</p></div><main class="content container"><div class=post><header><h1 class=post-title>FAQs</h1></header><h2 id=coronavirus>Coronavirus</h2><details><summary>Will there be a season this year?</summary><div class=details-container>YES! Both National and Virginia Science Olympiad have pledged to conduct safe competitions and activities throughout the year. This means we WILL run this season – and as always, we’re committed to providing the best possible experience for the team!</div></details><details><summary>What will the season look like?</summary><div class=details-container>While plans for the entire season are still up in the air, we know that the first few months (through mid-February) will be virtual. The most up-to-date information can be found on Virginia Science Olympiad’s <a href=https://virginiaso.org>website</a>.</div></details><details><summary>What will the application process look like this year?</summary><div class=details-container><p>This year, the application process will be conducted entirely virtually. While this means things will look different in practice, the spirit of our metrics will be maintained as much as possible. And as always, we will strive for a fair, holistic, and (especially) equitable process.</p><p>At this point, we cannot share many details for the sake of test integrity. However, you can expect the same components as past years, just adapted to an online format. These include an application form to be submitted prior to the diagnostic; a diagnostic exam testing problem-solving skills and aptitude for certain topic areas; a teamwork evaluation; and an optional pre-prepared supplement for those interested in building events.</p></div></details><details><summary>How will the safety of participants be ensured?</summary><div class=details-container>Team meetings and tournaments will be conducted virtually for as long as the situation requires. Events will also be adapted to a safe, at-home format. For example, lab events will not involve chemicals or lab equipment; the data will be obtained through the written test instead.</div></details><h2 id=science-olympiad-and-tjso>Science Olympiad and TJSO</h2><details><summary>Does Science Olympiad require background knowledge and/or prior experience?</summary><div class=details-container>Absolutely not! While background knowledge and experience may be helpful for some events, they are not necessary for success. You will find an entire team of wonderful people to get you on board.</div></details><details><summary>Is Science Olympiad year-round or is it seasonal?</summary><div class=details-container>SO is considered a year-round activity, with each new year of SO called a “season”. However, due to competition policy, we must select a states team of 15 people from the original 45; this means the entire team will be active during the fall and winter, and the states team then continues competing into the spring. For more on the states team, see <a href=#the-states-team>below</a>.</div></details><details><summary>How much time commitment does Science Olympiad require?</summary><div class=details-container><p>To preface, doing Science Olympiad at TJ is NOT mutually exclusive with other activities and sports. In fact, many of our members are also committed to activities such as marching band, cross country, Biology Olympiad, swim, debate, and so on. What doing Science Olympiad does mean, however, is making it one of your top priorities: Your success is proportional to the effort you put in, and for TJSO in particular, the team and your partners rely on your commitment.</p><p>You can at least expect two hours each week for our weekly Thursday after-school meetings, but the majority of time spent preparing will be at home in your own free time. Exactly how much time you spend is largely dependent on your events and your partners – we recommend developing a weekly schedule with your partner. As an example, for a study event, this might include spending two hours each weekend taking tests and studying together with your partner.</p></div></details><details><summary>What kinds of events are in Science Olympiad?</summary><div class=details-container><p>There are a few broad categories of events: study events, lab events, building events, and inquiry events.</p><ul><li>Study: you will be expected to take an exam, generally using a restricted set of resources as aid. These resources might look like a binder, a laptop without internet connection, or a set number of sheets of paper.</li><li>Lab: a study event with a hands-on lab portion. This might entail a chemistry experiment, constructing circuits, or testing different samples in a forensics situation.</li><li>Build: you design and build one or more devices according to a set of specifications and test them on competition day. These events may include a test portion as well.</li><li>Inquiry: A miscellaneous section! Some events focus on the nature of science/meta-skills, like Experimental Design and Write It Do It, while other events are just cool things Science Olympiad didn’t have another place for, like Codebusters.</li></ul><p>The National Science Olympiad organization sorts events into five topical categories; you can see their categorization <a href=https://www.soinc.org/events/2021-event-table>here</a>, under “C Events”.</p></div></details><details><summary>Is Codebusters a programming event?</summary><div class=details-container>No – it’s cryptography!! The “codes” in Codebusters are messages that you need to encode and decode using a variety of ciphers.</div></details><details><summary>What are the different levels of Science Olympiad competitions?</summary><div class=details-container>There are three levels of competitions, which work in a progression: regional competitions, state competitions, and the Science Olympiad National Tournament. Performing well enough at regionals will qualify you for the state tournament, and winning states will qualify you for Nationals. In addition, there are invitational tournaments run solely for practice; they don’t affect the team’s progression.</div></details><details><summary>What does a tournament look like?</summary><div class=details-container><p>Tournaments begin early in the morning and are split into roughly seven sessions, during which individual events are run. Each participant will generally have 3-4 events, leaving a few sessions of downtime for them to prepare. There is usually some passing time between each session, as well as a lunch break. Once the event sessions have concluded, we’ll hang out and grab a bite to eat before the awards ceremony in the evening.</p><p>The atmosphere and memories with the team you get are much harder to describe; you’ll have to trust us when we say it’s one of the best experiences of TJSO!</p></div></details><details><summary>What financial commitments are required?</summary><div class=details-container><p>We ask for a fee (~$40-70) at the beginning of the season to cover the costs of tournament registration, t-shirts, and pizza. Before each tournament (usually 2 for the 45-person team and 2-3 more for the states team), we collect fees for travel/lodging expenses (~$100, potentially less or none if no bus or hotel, as in the case of regionals). For build events, you’ll also need to cover the costs of individual-use materials.</p><p>If you have trouble paying the full costs, it’s absolutely not required for membership – just let us know about it! We will definitely work with your financial needs.</p><p>Due to the impact of coronavirus this season, some of the fees associated with attending tournaments (as well as after-school pizza) will be reduced.</p></div></details><h2 id=the-states-team>The States Team</h2><details><summary>Can you tell me more about the states team?</summary><div class=details-container><p>We start each season with three teams of 15 (collectively termed our “regionals team”), which compete at at least one invitational tournament and one regionals tournament. Due to competition policy, however, we are only allowed to send one team of 15 to states and beyond; as such, we choose 15 team members of the original 45 to represent TJSO at states. Selection is done by our sponsors and is largely data-driven, based on factors like placements, event coverage, and overall contribution to the team.</p><p>Not making the states team doesn’t mean you’re “kicked out” – everyone is welcome back to practices, either to help out or challenge the states team for fun!</p></div></details><details><summary>Can freshmen make the states team? (I heard it’s impossible…)</summary><div class=details-container><p>Yes! Freshmen are almost always on the states team, either as alternates or as part of the main competition.</p><p>We treat freshmen and new members just as any other member; they bring home just as many medals and are essential to our team dynamic.</p></div></details><details><summary>Do officers automatically make the states team?</summary><div class=details-container>No. Officers undergo the exact same selection process as other team members. All members, regardless of prior experience, are given equal chances based solely on their abilities.</div></details><h2 id=applying-to-tjso>Applying to TJSO</h2><details><summary>Should I prepare for the diagnostic test?</summary><div class=details-container>There is no need to prepare for the diagnostic; we will be testing your ability to problem solve, not necessarily how much you know about science.</div></details><details><summary>Whom may I list as my reference in my application?</summary><div class=details-container>As the application form indicates, you may list any previous teacher or coach. This includes division B coaches and, if you have been on TJSO before, TJSO sponsors.</div></details><hr><p>If you have more questions, feel free to <a href=https://tjscioly.org/leadership-contact/>contact us</a> at <a href=mailto:tjhsstscio@gmail.com>tjhsstscio@gmail.com</a>!</p></div><footer><p>Last modified on Wed, Sep 9, 2020</p></footer></main><footer id=mobile><div class=copyright-text><p>© TJ Science Olympiad 2017-2020</p><p>Maintained by Shreyas Mayya</p></div><div class=social-media-link><a href=https://www.facebook.com/tjscioly><svg viewBox="0 0 1024 1024"><path d="M1024 512C1024 229.23 794.77.0 512 0 229.23.0.0 229.23.0 512 0 767.554 187.231 979.3699 432 1017.7801V660H302V512H432V399.2C432 270.88 508.438 2e2 625.39 2e2 681.407 2e2 740 210 740 210V336H675.438C611.835 336 592 375.467 592 415.957V512H734L711.3 660H592v357.7801C836.769 979.3699 1024 767.554 1024 512"/></svg></a><a href=https://www.instagram.com/tjscioly/><svg viewbox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M256 49.471c67.266.0 75.233.257 101.8 1.469 24.562 1.121 37.9 5.224 46.778 8.674a78.052 78.052.0 0128.966 18.845 78.052 78.052.0 0118.845 28.966c3.45 8.877 7.554 22.216 8.674 46.778 1.212 26.565 1.469 34.532 1.469 101.8s-.257 75.233-1.469 101.8c-1.121 24.562-5.225 37.9-8.674 46.778a83.427 83.427.0 01-47.811 47.811c-8.877 3.45-22.216 7.554-46.778 8.674-26.56 1.212-34.527 1.469-101.8 1.469s-75.237-.257-101.8-1.469c-24.562-1.121-37.9-5.225-46.778-8.674a78.051 78.051.0 01-28.966-18.845 78.053 78.053.0 01-18.845-28.966c-3.45-8.877-7.554-22.216-8.674-46.778-1.212-26.564-1.469-34.532-1.469-101.8s.257-75.233 1.469-101.8c1.121-24.562 5.224-37.9 8.674-46.778A78.052 78.052.0 0178.458 78.458a78.053 78.053.0 0128.966-18.845c8.877-3.45 22.216-7.554 46.778-8.674 26.565-1.212 34.532-1.469 101.8-1.469m0-45.391c-68.418.0-77 .29-103.866 1.516-26.815 1.224-45.127 5.482-61.151 11.71a123.488 123.488.0 00-44.62 29.057A123.488 123.488.0 0017.3 90.982C11.077 107.007 6.819 125.319 5.6 152.134 4.369 179 4.079 187.582 4.079 256S4.369 333 5.6 359.866c1.224 26.815 5.482 45.127 11.71 61.151a123.489 123.489.0 0029.057 44.62 123.486 123.486.0 0044.62 29.057c16.025 6.228 34.337 10.486 61.151 11.71 26.87 1.226 35.449 1.516 103.866 1.516s77-.29 103.866-1.516c26.815-1.224 45.127-5.482 61.151-11.71a128.817 128.817.0 0073.677-73.677c6.228-16.025 10.486-34.337 11.71-61.151 1.226-26.87 1.516-35.449 1.516-103.866s-.29-77-1.516-103.866c-1.224-26.815-5.482-45.127-11.71-61.151a123.486 123.486.0 00-29.057-44.62A123.487 123.487.0 00421.018 17.3C404.993 11.077 386.681 6.819 359.866 5.6 333 4.369 324.418 4.079 256 4.079h0z"/><path d="M256 126.635A129.365 129.365.0 10385.365 256 129.365 129.365.0 00256 126.635zm0 213.338A83.973 83.973.0 11339.974 256 83.974 83.974.0 01256 339.973z"/><circle cx="390.476" cy="121.524" r="30.23"/></svg></a></div></footer></body></html>
